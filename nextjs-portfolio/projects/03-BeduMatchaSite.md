# Matcha Mock Blog

The first exam project i had for my course with Bedu, was this mock blog. I r enjoyed it,

Before this I had done some small components with `html` and `css` and coming out of my previous course `UI/UX`, i had a strong design notion. So i was able to get a better understanding of the design challenge apart from scaffolding a functional site.

## What i leaned

This project has been so long i wish i had a bette descripotion of what i learned but from what i recall it was the first multipage project coding project i had.  

- `@use` imports in scss tro call functions and variables from other files.
- In this project i started to try and use semantic `html` tags.

I remember being overwhelmed with the limitations that multipage html when trying to reuse components.
